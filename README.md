The Written Analysis
1. Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis
The purpose of the project, “Outcomes Based on goals” is to analyze the data and
group the project with respect to goals, number successful, number failed, number
canceled, total projects, percentage successful, percentage failed and percentage
canceled. And each category based on specific amounts.
The purpose of the project: “Theater Outcomes by Launch Date” is analyze the
functions used to populate the “Number successful,” “Number Failed,” and “Number
canceled. While the percentages of successful, failed, and canceled are calculated
based on the data from the “Total Project.”

2. Analysis and challenges: Explain how you performed your analysis using images and links to code, as well as any challenges you encountered and how you overcame them.
If you had no challenges, describe any possible challenges or difficulties that could be
encountered.
I experienced a lot of challenges creating graphs with Excel as it is all new area for me. I
had to work diligently going through each page. I ran into a lot of problems, missing
some columns and going back to recreate all of them from the start.  
3. Results: answer the following questions in complete and coherent sentences.
The following conclusions are from the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date:
- The two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?
In the month of May, the successful spiked significantly to 111, whereas the failed
went down to 52, and the canceled only 3.
In the month of December, spike of successful, failed and went down significantly,
while in the same month, the canceled stayed the same.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on goals?
My conclusion is that the canceled stayed almost the same from January to
December.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The limitations are that the formula was quite difficult to use swithing back and forth.  The following conclusions are from the Outcomes Based on Goal:
- The conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes Based on Goal:
The percentage of goals oriented were between 20% to below 80% in less than 1000
range and stayed the same withing 25,000 to less than 30,000. But the percentage
of the goals widened significantly between 45,000 to just below 50,000.
